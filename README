and Rodolfo Cuerno.


1. PURPOSE

A program to compute geodesics and balls in 2D Riemannian manifolds.

See http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0209 for a research application of this
code. 


2. INSTALLATION

The program is written in C++ for a UNIX environment with gcc
compilers, BLAS & LAPACK.

In order to watch all the animations, you need the following
libraries, including the development files:

* BLAS & LAPACK
* X11

For example, in ubuntu, apply the following command:

>> sudo apt-get install g++ libblas3 libblas-dev liblapack3 liblapack-dev libx11-dev

In other UNIX systems the packages may have different names.

Now enter each directory and do:

>> make xriemann
>> ./xriemann

A window should open, and an image like that in example.png should
appear.
